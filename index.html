                <p>I have my permanent muses and my muses of the moment. My dresses are very reasonably priced, for dresses that are cut on the body. Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity. Beauty is perfect in its imperfections, so you just have to go with the imperfections. I am what I am. Before I was not so proud to make fashion. My family thought fashion wasn't very interesting. So I hid that.</p>

                <p>I couldn't love a woman who inspired me to be totally disinterested. If I fell in love with a woman for an artistic reason, or from the point of view of my work, I think it would rob her of something. Nostalgia is a very complicated subject for me. I'm attracted by nostalgia but I refuse it intellectually. There has to be a balance between your mental satisfaction and the financial needs of your company. I try as much as possible to give you a great basic product and what comes out, I feel, is really amazing. Elegance isn't solely defined by what you wear. It's how you carry yourself, how you speak, what you read.</p>

                <p>Fashions fade, style is eternal. In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish. I'd like to believe that the women who wear my clothes are not dressing for other people, that they're wearing what they like and what suits them. It's not a status thing. Comfort is very important to me. I think people live better in big houses and in big clothes. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of.</p>
