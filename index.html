            <p>I have my permanent muses and my muses of the moment. My dresses are very reasonably priced, for dresses that are cut on the body. Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity. Beauty is perfect in its imperfections, so you just have to go with the imperfections. I am what I am. Before I was not so proud to make fashion. My family thought fashion wasn't very interesting. So I hid that.</p>

            <p>I don't like trends. They tend to make everybody look the same. I get ideas about what's essential when packing my suitcase. First I made a dress because I was pregnant and I wanted to be the most beautiful pregnant woman. Then I made a sweater because I wanted to have one that wasn't like anyone else's.

            <p>I couldn't love a woman who inspired me to be totally disinterested. If I fell in love with a woman for an artistic reason, or from the point of view of my work, I think it would rob her of something. Nostalgia is a very complicated subject for me. I'm attracted by nostalgia but I refuse it intellectually. There has to be a balance between your mental satisfaction and the financial needs of your company. I try as much as possible to give you a great basic product and what comes out, I feel, is really amazing. Elegance isn't solely defined by what you wear. It's how you carry yourself, how you speak, what you read.</p>

It pains me physically to see a woman victimized, rendered pathetic, by fashion. Comfort is very important to me. I think people live better in big houses and in big clothes.</p>

Comfort is very important to me. I think people live better in big houses and in big clothes. I never like to think that I design for a particular person.

            <p>Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.

Then their outlook changes. They feel more joyous. Even Michelangelo got paid for doing the Sistine Chapel. To those artists who say they're doing it for the love of art, I say: Get real.

            <p>However, this also doesn’t mean that focusing on fashion related content is the answer. As a thought exercise, consider how much work a company like Vogue puts into its fashion content. How hard do you think it is to become a writer there? How many years spent dedicated to writing about fashion do you think they expect from someone before they’ll publish their work? How well plugged into the fashion world do you think their writers are? Now contrast this to who you might have writing fashion related content for a company like Neiman Marcus. Do you really think a retail-focused company like Neiman Marcus can compete with a company like Vogue that is built from the ground up for one purpose (fashion content)?</p>

            <p>The solution is to own a specific content niche that relates well to your brand. The best example of this is Nasty Gal. Rather than writing about fall fashion trends, they write about empowered women. They interview female role models, have a podcast and run a microsite, Girlboss.com, that showcases their podcast, physical book, newsletter and the financial aid they give to women.</p>

            <p>Nasty Gal is a great example of how to avoid oversaturated content spaces and find an on-brand niche that you can own. Other brands can follow suit by honing in on what makes them unique and owning it. For example, Nordstrom could do something related to exceptional service or people helping each other out, Bloomingdale’s could do something related to the “Bloomingdale’s lifestyle”, Burberry could do something related to legacy/history and so on.</p>

            <p>But the tieback to Louis Vuitton is so minimal (there are a total of 10 pages that even mention Louis Vuitton in the title and too few links to louisvuitton.com to even register on ahrefs or Open Site Explorer) that you have to dig deeper to really find the value it provides. From my perspective, there are a few ways Louis Vuitton benefits from Nowness..</p>
